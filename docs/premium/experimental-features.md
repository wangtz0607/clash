# Experimental Features

Occasionally we make new features that would require a fair amount of testing before having it in the main release. These features are marked as experimental and are disabled by default.

::: warning
Some features listed here can be unstable, and might get removed in any future version - we do not recommend using them unless you have a specific reason to do so.

## Sniff TLS SNI

```yaml
experimental:
  sniff-tls-sni: true
```
